# NEW-Movies-ETL

## Purpose

The overview of this project is to perform ETL (extract, transform, and load) on datasets to predict results for the streaming service, Amazing Prime. The data is pertaining specifically to movies extracted from Wikipedia, Kaggle, and MovieLens files. After working through the large raw data files, the collection was transformed, merged, cleaned, and loaded into a SQL dataframe for future queries to be run. The purpose of this specific project was to create an automated pipline that simplifies the ETL process for all three files. After all code was refactored and cleaned, the data was added to a PostgreSQL database.
